Two bets:
- Who holds the team with the snitch at the end of the regular season?
- Who holds the team with the most games won claiming/holding the snitch?

I've altered the second bet to make this basic analysis simpler.
The actual bet gives each team 1pt for each day they hold the snitch,
but I don't care to do that date math.

  - specifically the _latest.csv file

  - less helpful than I'd hoped


Naive approach:
Start with the Lightning's first game and build out every possible branch

Problem:
2^82 is a very big number

Wolfram Alpha says:

  4.835703278458516698824704 * 10^24
  4,835,703,278,458,516,698,824,704

This is much lower than estimated number of atoms in the Earth
(roughly 1.33 * 10^53)


I need to be smarter.


What are the goals of this analysis:
- Score each team by likelihood of holding snitch at end of season.
- Score each team by opportunities to claim the snitch.


I can think of two approaches:
a) Calculation: Which teams play Lightning most? Which teams play those teams most? Etc...
b) Simulation:  Give each team 50-50 odds to win. Simulate 10,000 seasons and count.


How confident am I in my ability to do a rigorous calculation?
Seems not-too-hard?


Matchup details from the NHL press release:

  Reminder: Scheduling Matrix
  Each Division Has Eight Teams

  Games Within Division
  5 teams x 2 home / 2 away (Subtotal 10 home / 10 away)
  1 team  x 2 home / 1 away (Subtotal 2 home / 1 away)
  1 team  x 1 home / 2 away (Subtotal 1 home / 2 away)

  Games Within Conference (Non-Division)
  4 teams x 2 home / 1 away (Subtotal 8 home / 4 away)
  4 teams x 1 home / 2 away (Subtotal 4 home / 8 away)

  Non-Conference Games    
  16 teams x 1 home / 1 away (Subtotal 16 home / 16 away)

  Grand Total - 82 Games
  41 home / 41 away


I need to get this CSV from Five Thirty Eight
translated into JSON because NodeJS doesn't have
CSV parsing in the standard library.

Guess I need to write a short Python script.
Yeesh.


Before getting into that script, I should decide on
what I want the JSON to look like.

Team:
- slug
- location (Carolina, etc)
- name (Panthers, etc)

Game:
- date (YYYY-mm-dd)
- home team slug
- away team slug

I'm more interested in writing the simulation
than in writing the calculation.


What does one season look like?
- per-team counts for "snitch games won"
- load snitch history into team scores
- track team that currently holds the snitch
- find next game for snitch team
- flip the coin
- assign snitch
- repeat


Must figure out basic date math for this.

I guess assume each game happens at 12:00:00
and add 86400000ms to move forward one day.
